## Examples

Traditional example of login button enabling/disabling by email and password field validation:
```kotlin
combine(
    etEmail.textChanges() // Flow<CharSequence>
        .map { Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS.matcher(it).matches() },

    etPassword.textChanges() // Flow<CharSequence>
        .map { it.length > 7 },

    transform = { email, password -> email && password }
)
    .onEach { btLogin.isEnabled = it }
    .flowWithLifecycle(lifecycle)
    .launchIn(lifecycleScope) // lifecycle-runtime-ktx
```

Handle an authorization event, which can be started by pressing a button `bt_login` or by pressing an action `EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_DONE` on the keyboard:
```kotlin
merge(
    btLogin.clicks(), // Flow<Unit>

    etPassword.editorActionEvents() // Flow<TextViewEditorActionEvent>
        .filter { it.actionId == EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_DONE }
        .filter { btLogin.isEnabled }
)
    .onEach { /* handle an authorization event */}
    .flowWithLifecycle(lifecycle)
    .launchIn(lifecycleScope) // lifecycle-runtime-ktx
```

Handle nfc adapter state changed
```kotlin
context
    .receivesBroadcast(
        IntentFilter(NfcAdapter.ACTION_ADAPTER_STATE_CHANGED)
    ) // Flow<Intent>
    .onEach { /* handle nfc adapter state changed */ }
    .flowWithLifecycle(lifecycle)
    .launchIn(lifecycleScope) // lifecycle-runtime-ktx
```

Handle status bars or navigation bars visibility
```kotlin
window.decorView.windowInsetsApplyEvents() // Flow<WindowInsetsEvent>
    .map { event ->
        with(event) {
            view.onApplyWindowInsets(insets)
        }
    }
    .map { insets ->
        insets.isVisible(WindowInsets.Type.statusBars() or WindowInsets.Type.navigationBars())
    }
    .onEach { /* handle status bars or navigation bars visibility */ }
    .flowWithLifecycle(lifecycle)
    .launchIn(lifecycleScope) // lifecycle-runtime-ktx
```
