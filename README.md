# Corbind

Kotlin Coroutine binding APIs for Android UI widgets from the platform and support libraries. **Supports Flow, ReceiveChannel and Actor**.


## Description

This library is for Android applications only. Help you to transform Android UI events into cold [Flow][flow], hot [ReceiveChannel][channel] or just perform an action through an [Actor][actor].


## Download

Coming soon.


## Missed or forgot something

If I forgot something or you have any ideas what can be added or corrected, please create an issue or contact me directly. I am interested in making this library better.
